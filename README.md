After years of service, this package has been made obsolete by the combination of the following:

* The [rewrite](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/pull/1662) of Sublime Text's default Go grammar
* The community [LSP client](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) for Sublime Text
* Go's [official LSP server](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls)
